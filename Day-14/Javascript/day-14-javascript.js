// - --------------------------  Activity 1: Class Definition

// Task 1: Define a class Person with properties name and age, and a method to return a greeting message. Create an instance of the class and log the greeting message.

class Person {
	constructor(name, age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}

	greeting() {
		return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and my age ` + `is ${this.age}.`;
	}
}

const person = new Person("Alice", 30);

console.log(person.greeting());

// Task 2: Add a method to the Person class that updates the age property and logs the updated age.

person.updateAge = function (newAge) {
	this.age = newAge;
	console.log(`Age updated to ${this.age}.`);
};

person.updateAge(31);
person.greeting();

// ------------------------------------ Activity 2: Class Inheritance

// Task 3: Define a class Student that extends the Person class. Add a property studentId and a method to return the student ID. Create an instance of the Student class and log the student ID.

// Task 4: Override the greeting method in the Student class to include the student ID in the message. Log the overridden greeting message.

// ------------------------------- Activity 3: Static Methods and Properties

// Task 5: Add a static method to the Person class that returns a generic greeting message. Call this static method without creating an instance of the class and log the message.

// Task 6: Add a static property to the Student class to keep track of the number of students created. Increment this property in the constructor and log the total number of students.

// ----------------------------------------- Activity 4: Getters and Setters

// Task 7: Add a getter method to the Person class to return the full name (assume firstName and lastName properties). Create an instance and log the full name using the getter.

// Task 8: Add a setter method to the Person class to update the name properties (firstName and lastName). Update the name using the setter and log the updated full name.

// ---------------------------------- Activity 5: Private Fields (Optional)

// Task 9: Define a class Account with private fields for balance and a method to deposit and withdraw money. Ensure that the balance can only be updated through these methods.

// Task 10: Create an instance of the Account class and test the deposit and withdraw methods, logging the balance after each operation.
